# One Click - Deleven Pi 4

Its a script where after the initial Setup of the Pi, evrything else gets install and added Manually, such as:

* Install apps
* add cronjobs
* Mount NAS  etc.
* create necessary directory
* create necessary files

## How to use the Script

The Idea of the script is, that you download it to your Pi, then edit it to your liking, and let it run

All Paths, IPs etc. are examples only, you need to adjust it to your specifics.
