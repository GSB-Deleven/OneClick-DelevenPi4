# One Click - Deleven Pi 4

Its a script where after the initial Setup of the Pi, evrything else gets install and added Manually, such as:

* Install apps
* add cronjobs
* Mount NAS  etc.
* create necessary directory
* create necessary files
* create alias
* overclock (maybe)
* everything should get updated, upgraded and cleaned up

## How to use the Script

The Idea of the script is, that you download it to your Pi, then edit it to your liking, and let it run

## How to read and change the Script

All Paths, IPs etc. are examples only, you need to adjust it to your specifics.
